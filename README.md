## 📍 Overview

Basic NLP project to classify phishing emails from spam emails. This project is based on the [Spam Email raw text for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 18,650 emails, 7,000 of which are spam emails and others are not spam emails

This project is my report for my NLP course at the EPF school during my 5th year of engineering school. 

It is a first foot in the NLP world, so I tried to use the most basic models and techniques to classify the emails with ML models. I also tried Deep Learning for the first time.

## 📧 Spam Classification

This Project is based on Spam Email detection. The goal is to classify emails as spam or not spam. To do that we will use different NLP techniques and models.

Here is an explanation on how to classify emails as spam or not spam:

## 🤝 General Conclusion

This project presents an initial foray into the world of NLP, employing fundamental NLP techniques and models to classify emails as spam or not. It provides insights into the performance of basic models and serves as a stepping stone for future improvements

 The basic model is a good start to classify emails as spam or not. Also It is a good model to start with and to have a first idea of the performance of the model but I think that Deep Leraning models are more efficient for this kind of problem. I just don't have enough time to improve the Deep Learning model now.

But the result that I have are not really relevant, RNN is more perfomant but has a large traning size and training time. I think that I can improve the model by changing the Deep Learning model and the NLP encoding methods. I will try to improve the model in the future.
